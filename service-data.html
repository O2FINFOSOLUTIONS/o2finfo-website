          <h1>Legacy Modernization</h1>
          <p>Cloud and Big Data are gaining foothold in several industries, including yours. What’s needed at this hour is application modernization, and legacy modernization is the way to go. </p>
          <br/>
          <h2>What is legacy modernization?</h2>
          <p>It’s all about reusing, modernizing and migrating existing business applications to newer technology stacks so that you can align them with your current business objective. </p>
          <p>Legacy systems cost a lot to maintain, as you’ve probably found out. This, and the lack of adequate skill sets and doubtless business risks are moving several enterprises around the world towards modernizing their applications. Legacy modernization includes all or several of the following services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Application migration</li>
            <li>Application Re-engineering</li>
            <li>Database Migration and Prototype Development Services</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <h2>The advantages of legacy modernization </h2>
          <p>Legacy applications are business knowledge repositories. As you move towards modernization, you need to ensure that this knowledge is validated, implemented, successfully redeployed into the new system to ensure business continuity. We embrace a holistic approach to legacy modernization that is in line with your business goals. Here are some of the advantages of modernizing existing legacy systems:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enhanced User Experience: Imagine shifting from character-based screens to rich Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). You’ll be vastly improving online end-user experience and customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Modification of Existing Applications: Tightly coupled parts of existing applications cannot be easily modified to modern workflows. In such cases, we will focus on adapting the entire application instead of phasing it out.</li>
            <li>Creation of Newer Capabilities: It is necessary to create new solutions and plug them into existing applications in order to adapt to changing market conditions. We can achieve this by doing a proper analysis and re-engineering of existing applications.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The time to modernize legacy systems is now. The cost of modernization is nothing compared to the cost of maintaining them. Plus, skilled resources for legacy systems are in short supply. Modernization costs will skyrocket in the future so it’s the right time to modernize now. Contact us now if you are convinced that you need to go in for legacy modernization.</p>

          <h1>Advanced Analytics</h1>
          <p>Advanced analytics is data analysis that goes beyond simple mathematics. It goes beyond simple filtering and sorting.

            <li>Classic customer value and success forecasts</li>
            <li>Prevention of contract termination or price</li>
            <li>Sales and demand forecasts </li>
            <li>Prediction of machine failures</li>
            <li>Social media monitoring and evaluation</li>
            <li>Predictive policing</li>
